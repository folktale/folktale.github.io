  <div class="feature-boxes">
    <div class="feature">
      <h3 class="feature-title">Compositional</h3>

      <p>Purity makes it easy to create new functionality by just putting smaller components together, and Folktale's combinators make it <em>easier</em>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature">
      <h3 class="feature-title">Better error handling</h3>

      <p><strong>throw</strong> and <strong>try/catch</strong> are hard to reason about. Folktale's <strong>Maybe</strong> and <strong>Result</strong> support abstracting over errors, and simplify reasoning.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="feature">
      <h3 class="feature-title">Safer concurrency</h3>

      <p>Folktale provides <strong>Task</strong>, a way of declaring and combining asynchronous actions that supports automatic resource management.</p>
