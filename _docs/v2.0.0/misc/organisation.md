## Issue tracker

Ideas and bugs live in the [Github Issue tracker](https://github.com/origamitower/folktale/issues), and can be
visualised as a Kanban board in [Waffle.io](waffle.io/origamitower/folktale).
If you're not sure where to start, there's a selection of [good first
issues](https://waffle.io/origamitower/folktale?label=e:Good%20First%20Issue)
which you may want to try.

All tasks are categorised in terms of the kind of work, its scope, its
effort, its status, and its priority. 

Here's what the labels mean:

  - `c:*` — The **category** labels classify the scope of the issue.
  - `e:*` — The **effort** labels define how much effort resolving a particular
    issue is likely to take.
  - `p:*` — The **priority** labels define how urgent resolving a particular
    issue is.

Kind labels:

  - `k:Enhancement` — The task refers to something that improves the Folktale
    library, such as adding new features or making existing features easier
    to use.
  - `k:Error` — The task refers to a problem with the Folktale library. We
    consider problems not only bugs, but things like missing documentation and
    confusing behaviour.
  - `k:Optimisation` — The task doesn't change anything about the behaviour of
    Folktale, but it improves the performance of some of its components.
  - `k:Discussion` — Discussions about features that don't fit any of the
    kinds above.

Status labels:

  - `s:Duplicate` — The issue is already covered by a separate issue, and
    should be discussed there.
  - `s:Invalid` — The issue is not a problem in Folktale.
  - `s:Won't Fix` — The issue does not fit Folktale's philosophy.

All triaged issues will at least contain a `category` label and a `kind` label.


## Repository

The Folktale repository is organised as follows:

  - `/folktale` — Root of the project.

    Configuration files:

      - `.babelrc`
         — Configurations for the Babel compiler.
      - `.eslintrc.json`
         — Linting rules for ESLint.
      - `package.json`
        — Meta-data for the npm package (version, description, dependencies, etc).
      - `.travis.yml`
        — Configuration for running automated tests in the Travis CI server.
      - `.eslintignore`
        — A set of glob patterns for files that shouldn't be linted.
      - `.npmignore`
        — A set of glob patterns for files that shouldn't be included in npm's packages.
      - `.gitignore`
        — A set of glob patterns for files that shouldn't be committed to the repository.


    Documentation files:

      - `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
        — Social rules that all people in the community are expected to follow.
      - `CONTRIBUTING.md`
        — This file. A guide for people who want to contribute to Folktale.
      - `README.md`
        — Tells people what Folktale is for, how to install it, how to begin using it, where to get support, and other important information.
      - `LICENCE`
        — The licence under which Folktale is released (MIT).
      - `CONTRIBUTORS`
        — A list of all people who have contributed to Folktale.
      - `CHANGELOG.md`
        — A chronological list of changes made to the project, grouped by versions.
      - `docs/source`
        — Special markdown/YAML documentation files, separated by language.



    Developer tooling:

      - `Makefile`
        — Common development tasks.
      - `tools`
        — Custom tooling written for Folktale.
      - `metamagical/`
        — A set of tools to support documentation and tests.


    Source files:

      - `src/`
        — The implementation of Folktale libraries, in JavaScript.
      - `test/`
        — Unit tests for Folktale, using Mocha.


    Auto-generated files:

      - `index.js`, `core/`, `data/`, `helpers`
        — Generated from the source code in `src/` through `make compile`. These are the library's code that gets loaded by requiring the package.

      - `annotated/`
        — Generated from the source code in `src/` through `make compile-annotated`. Contains special annotations for the documentation tooling.

      - `dist/`
        — Generated with `make bundle`. Distribution files for browser environments, compiled with Browserify.

      - `docs/build/`
        — Generated from documentation files in `docs/source/` through `make compile-documentation`. Used to generate documentation and test examples in the documentation.

      - `docs/api/`
        — Static HTML documentation, generated through `make documentation`.

      - `node_modules/`
        — Dependencies installed by npm.

      - `test/helpers/` and `test/specs/`
        — Generated from their `*-src/` folder through `make compile-test`. These are the test files that get actually ran by the testing tool.

      - `test/browser/browser-tests.js`
        — Generated from `test.js` through `make compile-test`. A bundle of the entire library and test files that can be loaded in a browser.

      - `releases/`
        — Generated through `publish`. Contains distribution packages.


## Source hierarchy

The source tree is organised as a hierarchy of objects. At each level you have
an `index.js` file that re-exports functions and objects of that level. This
allows people to import bags of features, or a particular feature separately.

  - `core` — Provides the baseline for all features in Folktale, by filling the
    gaps of the functionality needed for the standard data structures. The
    purpose of `core` is to just provide enough functionality to make other
    categories possible. The focus is on better data structures and composing
    data structures.

      - `lambda` — Common combinators for functions.
      - `adt` — Support for algebraic data types.
      - `object` — Support working with objects-as-records/dictionaries.
      - `string` — Common operations on strings.
      - `comparison` — Comparisons between built-in JS values.
      - `equality` — Equality between built-in JS values.
      - `inspecting` — Textual representations of built-in JS values.
      - `contracts` — First and higher-order run-time contracts.
      - `iterables` — Lazy sequences using JS's iterable protocol.

  - `data` — Provides implementations of data structures that are common in
    functional programming.

      - `conversions` — Functions to convert between data types.
      - `maybe` — A structure for modelling the presence or absence of a value.
      - `result` — A structure for modelling a tagged disjunction of two values.
      - `validation` — A structure similar to Result, but designed for validations and supporting error aggregation.
      - `task` — A structure for modelling a potentially asynchronous action.
      - `future` — A structure for modelling an eventual value. Used by `task`.


## Test hierarchy

Folktale uses Mocha for testing, which expects tests to go in the `test/specs-src/`
folder. Right now all test files are placed directly in that folder.

Test files are named `<category>.<subcategory>.js` (e.g.: `core.lambda.es6`),
and provide tests for all functionality defined in that category. When compiled,
this generates `<category>.<subcategory>.js` files in the `test/specs/` folder.


## Build artefacts

Most of the source code is compiled through [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) before
running. This generates what we call "build artefacts" in the project's working
directory. While these files are ignored by Git (with `.gitignore` rules), they
might still show up in your text editor and be somewhat confusing.

When source code is compiled (from `src/`), the same structure you see under
`src/` is replicated under the root of the project's working directory. So, for
example, after compiling you'd have an `index.js` at the root, then an
`core/lambda/identity.js` starting at the root, and so on, and so forth.

When test cases are compiled (from `test/specs-src/` and `test/helpers-src/`), they
generate files with the same name in the `test/specs/` (and `test/helpers/`) folder.

Documentation files, in `docs/source/` are compiled to regular JavaScript files
that add special annotations to runtime objects. When compiled, the structure in
`docs/source/` is replicated in `docs/build/`.

You can always remove these files by running `make clean` from the root of the
project.
