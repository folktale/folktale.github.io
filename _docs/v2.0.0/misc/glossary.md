Tagged union
: A tagged union (also called "enum", "discriminated union", "sum type", or "variant") is a type of data structure that models a choice between several possible values, while identifying the value that it represents. Tagged unions help designing more robust programs by precisely modelling how a piece of data may be used. See the [conceptual documentation on tagged unions]({% link _docs/v2.0.0/concepts/tagged-unions.md %}) for more details.
