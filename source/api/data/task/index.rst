Module: ``data.task``
*********************

.. apimodule:: data.task


   Loading
   -------

   Require the ``data.task`` package, after installing it::

       var Task = require('data.task')

   This gives you back a :class:`data.task.Task` object.


   Why?
   ----

   This structure allows one to model side-effects (specially time-based ones)
   explicitly, such that one can have full knowledge of when they're dealing
   with delayed computations, latency, or anything that isn't pure or can be
   computed immediately.

   A common use of this structure is to replace the usual `Continuation-Passing
   Style`_ form of programming in order to be able to compose and sequence
   time-dependent effects using the generic and powerful monadic operations.
